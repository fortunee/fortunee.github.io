                <p>
                    Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fortune, I love code and I love to take raw ideas and build great products
                    with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                    <br> <br>
                    I currently provide software development services for
                    <a href="https://headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace Inc.</a>,
                    which is an <a href="https://andela.com/" target="_blank">Andela</a>
                    partner that focuses on improving the health, wellness and happiness of a person through series of
                    guided
                    meditations. I have extensive experience in building and scaling both client and server-side (Node)
                    applications
                    using test-driven development processes, and delivering clean
                    code that is easy to scale and maintain. <br> <br>
                    I'm also very adaptive and can dig in wherever needed, if I don't already know it, I'm willing to
                    learn it.
                    <br>
                    I like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, I just want to write simple code
                    and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).
                    <br> <br>
                    I mostly work in distributed Agile software development teams, and effective
                    communication is an essential tool for me, I use it for setting clear expectations with my team
                    members and stakeholders.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time with a loved one, seeing a movie and sometimes (despite
                    my better judgment)
                    performing stunt, freerunning and parkour.
